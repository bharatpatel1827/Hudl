Windows users: 

I had created this project in the Macbook pro. So browser driver is used for 64bits. 
Window user have to download browser driver as window requirement and copy .exe file in to the browserDirectory folder in the src/test/java. 

And please update in the location of browserDirectory path in BrowserSetup class by adding .exe at the end of path. 

This is maven project which we have to clone with all the dependencies together and it works fine. 

I has clone this project in window and followed above step. and it works absolutely fine for me. 

hope you guys can find easy way to do it. 

Thank you.
